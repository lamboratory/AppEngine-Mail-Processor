AppEngine Mail Processor is an application developed for Google's AppEngine platform to automatically process and perform specific tasks on mails.

Tired of clicking a link to confirm an account? Don't want to open and do always the same with some mails? Develop the Action to execute to process them and create a filter in your email account to forward some messages to the application. Next time you will just see the report mail for your Action and know it was already processed!

An example Action is provided (ClickLinksAction). It will click all links found in the mail and return the contents in the reply message.
Note: It's possible that this Action clicks unwanted links like unsubscribe links!
